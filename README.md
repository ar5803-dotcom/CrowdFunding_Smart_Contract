# CrowdFunding_Smart_Contract

This Solidity smart contract enables crowdfunding campaigns on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows creators to raise funds for their projects by accepting contributions from backers. The contract includes features such as setting a funding goal, a deadline for reaching the goal, and refund options for backers if the goal is not met within the specified timeframe.

# Initial Phase, when a fund of 50 ether has been raised for 100 minutes (deadline)

# Now as we can see that the fund raised is greater than the goal fund, so now only through the creator the the withdrawFund func can be called and the fund will be withdrawn and the respective boolean values will be changed appropriately.
